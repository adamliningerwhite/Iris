# Iris: A Vehicle Safety Monitoring System

## Project Description
According to the CDC, 1.35 million people are killed on roadways around the world each year. Many of these accidents are caused by drunk driving, drowsiness, distracted driving, and many others by preventable mistakes such as wearing a seatbelt.

I propose to build Iris, a computer vision system that uses Neural Networks to monitor passenger and driver behavior to minimize the probability of injury in case of an accident. 

### The Potential of Autonomy
Autonomous vehicles have the potential to reduce the number of driving accidents yet seatbelt wear and other safety precautions need to remain in place. In addition, many of the current advanced driver systems such as Tesla require a safety driver, thus additional safety monitoring is needed. Iris has significance and plays a part in the advancement of autonomous vehicles.

## Project Goals
1. Detect if all passengers are wearing seatbelts.
2. Detect safety driver gaze (to prevent distractions).
3. Detect extraordinary safety driver conditions such as drowsiness/sleepiness.
